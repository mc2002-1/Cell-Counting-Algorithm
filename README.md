# Cell-Counting-Algorithm
This project focuses on developing an automated algorithm for cell counting and segmentation using microscopy images. The algorithm processes these images to detect and count cell-like structures, handling complex scenarios where cells overlap or have irregular shapes. By employing various image processing techniques such as edge detection, smoothing, and adaptive thresholding, the algorithm accurately isolates cells within predefined regions of interest (ROIs) in the image.

The algorithm evaluates its performance by comparing detected cells with manually annotated ground truth (GT) data. Key evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, provide insights into the algorithm's accuracy and effectiveness in cell detection. The approach also calculates the Jaccard Index to assess the overlap between detected and actual cells, helping to fine-tune detection parameters.

Developed in MATLAB with the help of the Image Processing Toolbox, this solution is designed to be adaptable across different microscopy datasets. Its efficiency allows for rapid analysis of large sets of images, making it a valuable tool in biomedical research, particularly in studies involving cell proliferation, drug testing, or disease progression.
